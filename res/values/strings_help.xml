        The first one during Spring and Summer 2014, and the second during Winter 2015.
        </string>
        <string name="usageGuide">This app is divided in two main sections: 
            first, the test management part, and secondly, the status monitorization part.
            \nThe first part focuses on setting the test parameters and when to start a test. 
            \nThe second one shows live information of the current status for the ongoing test.
            \nThere are many aspects being monitored during a test, and even as soon as you run this app, 
            some information is already being monitored and logged into the device\'s file system.
            \nIn the log files you can find information about the CPU usage, the Battery state, 
            and all the Bluetooth related test-data per communication channel (ping times, message sizes, etc.)
